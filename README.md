# Cleaning my home

A child was playing and threw his plastic blocks into the aquarium, home of our little hero Crab. Now, you need to help him find the blocks and take them to the recycling bin.â€‹

There is a time limit for cleaning, but for each block found, you will gain an increment of time.

So let's do this: Help our little hero Crab in Cleaning His Home!
